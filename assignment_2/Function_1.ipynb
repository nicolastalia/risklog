    "## LP model to determine the shortest path\n",
    "To determine the shortest path to fulfill an order, we can implement a linear programming model which takes the order items that need to be obtained, and determines the shortest path to collect them all. The model assumes starting from the packaging area, collecting all items, and returning to the packaging area. The model is described below. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sets, parameters, variables\n",
    "$I$ : The set of items in the order, as well as the packaging section (labelled as $0$). Note, we can call the order items the nodes to hit.\n",
    "\n",
    "$d_{i j} :$ The distances between each node $i, j \\in I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$n :$ The number of items in the order $(I/\\{0\\})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_{i j} :$ The decision variable, it equals $1$ if you travel from node $i$ to node $j$ and $0$ if not. \n",
    "\n",
    "$y_{i} :$ A dummy decision variable which tracks the number of nodes visited before node $i$, this is used to ensure we do not revisit the packaging station prior to collecting all the items.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model\n",
    "Min $$\\sum_{i \\in I} \\sum_{j \\in J} x_{i j} d_{i j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Subject to $$\\sum_{i \\in I} x_{i j} = 1 \\quad \\forall j \\in I \\qquad (1)$$\n",
    "$$\\sum_{j \\in I} x_{i j} = 1 \\quad \\forall i \\in I \\qquad (2)$$\n",
    "$$x_{i i} = 0 \\quad \\forall i \\in I \\qquad (3)$$\n",
    "$$x_{i j} + x_{j i} \\leq 1 \\quad \\forall i \\in I, j \\in I \\quad (4)$$\n",
    "$$u_i - u_j + nx_{ij} \\leq n - 1 \\quad \\forall i \\neq j \\in I/\\{0\\} \\quad (5)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_{i j} \\in \\{0, 1\\}$$\n",

    "Note - constraint $(1)$ ensures that there is one arc into every node, and constraint $(2)$ ensures that there is one arc out of every node. Constraint $(3)$ ensures that you don't go from node i to node i. Constraint $(4)$ ensures that you cannot return back to the node you just came from. Constraint $(5)$ ensures that you don't return to packaging until all nodes have been hit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final constraint - constraint $(5)$ was taken from an mathematical article entitled \"Integer Programming Formulation of Traveling Salesman Problems\", which discusses the formulation of Travelling Salesman Problem when it is required that there are no sub-networks.

    "\n",
    "## Implementation of shortest path function\n",
    "We can define this model as a function which takes in the order, and returns the shortest path. This has been implemented below. Note that we firstly load in all the distances, and define the sets, parameters, and variables before adding constraints, the objective, and producing the output."
