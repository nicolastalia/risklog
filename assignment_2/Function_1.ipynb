    "# Function to determine the shortest path to fulfill an order\n",

    "## LP model to determine the shortest path\n",
    "To determine the shortest path to fulfill an order, we can implement a linear programming model which takes the order items that need to be obtained, and determines the shortest path to collect them all. The model assumes starting from the packaging area, collecting all items, and returning to the packaging area. The model is described below. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sets, parameters, variables\n",
    "$I$ : The set of items in the order, as well as the packaging section (labelled as $0$). Note, we can call the order items the nodes to hit.\n",
    "\n",
    "$d_{i j} :$ The distances between each node $i, j \\in I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$x_{i j} :$ The decision variable, it equals $1$ if you travel from node $i$ to node $j$ and $0$ if not. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model\n",
    "Min $$\\sum_{i \\in I} \\sum_{j \\in J} x_{i j} d_{i j}$$\n",
    "Subject to $$\\sum_{i \\in I} x_{i j} = 1 \\quad \\forall j \\in I \\qquad (1)$$\n",
    "$$\\sum_{j \\in I} x_{i j} = 1 \\quad \\forall i \\in I \\qquad (2)$$\n",
    "$$x_{i i} = 0 \\quad \\forall i \\in I \\qquad (3)$$\n",
    "$$x_{i j} + x_{j i} \\leq 1 \\quad \\forall i \\in I, j \\in I \\quad (3)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note - constraint $(1)$ ensures that there is one arc into every node, and constraitn $(2)$ ensures that there is one arc out of every node. Constraint $(3)$ ensures that you don't go to nowhere. Constraint $(4)$ ensures that you cannot return back to the node you just came from.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation of the function\n",
    "We can define this model as a function which takes in the order, and returns the shortest path. This has been implemented below. Note that we firstly load in all the distances, as well as the required packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "# NOTE - things to work out:\n",
    "1. Need to sort out the bug that it splits into $2$ cycles - i.e. goes packaging $\\rightarrow 1 \\rightarrow 27 \\rightarrow$ 0 then $6 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 5$ for example! Should start and end at $0$!\n",
    "1. Need to work out how best to display the outcome! "
